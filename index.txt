About me

I am a research assistant at D'Amore-McKim School of Business at Northeastern University, where I contribute to the development of large data sets that entail details of products under development by biotech start-ups. I am also pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Behavioral Science, with a keen interest in applying computational and cognitive methods to understand human behavior and decision making. My core competencies include statistical data analysis, community service, and analytical skills.

As a research assistant, I use established methodology and training provided by the professor to gather, input, and clean data, using python and other tools. I also participated as a research associate for clinical research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where I utilized computer-based image analysis techniques to various diseases, using ITK-SNAP, MATLAB, Monailabel, and 3D Slicer. I am motivated by the potential of data and neuroimaging to improve health outcomes and social welfare, and I seek to bring diverse perspectives and experiences to the team, and have received multiple honors for my academic and creative achievements.
